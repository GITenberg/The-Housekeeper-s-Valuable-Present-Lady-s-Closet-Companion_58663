  <h2 class='c007'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c008'>DURING the course of my apprenticeship
with Messrs. <span class='sc'>Negri</span> and
<span class='sc'>Gunter</span>, in <i>Berkeley Square</i>, many
housekeepers to noblemen and gentlemen,
on special occasions, were frequently
present, in order to observe our
<i>peculiar method</i> of preparing confects.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since I left Messrs. <span class='sc'>Negri</span> and
<span class='sc'>Gunter</span>, I have had frequent applications
from those persons, as well as
others, for receipts and information
respecting improvements and additions
to this art. But being engaged in the
service of several noblemen, and thereby
deprived of the opportunity of attending
to the numerous applications from respective
housekeepers for <i>New Receipts</i>,
I determined to form the following
Treatise, that they might present it to
their friends; and that it might supply
the place of personal application, I have
comprized in it every article that is necessary
to render the reader a proficient
in the art.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the nature of my occupation,
and the time necessary to acquire a due
knowledge of it, I cannot be supposed
qualified to write in a masterly stile;
and am therefore inclined to hope the
candid reader will be disposed to overlook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_IV'>IV</span>any little errors that may be observed
in this Treatise, considering it
not as the production of a scholar, but
the essay of a man, who has devoted the
greater part of his life to the pursuit of
the art under consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>I presume my having served an apprenticeship
to men of such eminence
in the line of Confectionary, and such
respectability in their connections as
Messrs. <span class='sc'>Negri &amp; Gunter</span>, that it will
be considered as a recommendation of
the following sheets; and as all the
Treatise I have seen contain only old
and exploded Receipts, render it necessary
that something new should appear
on the subject; and as the receipts I
have given are the result of my own
practice and experience, I think it will
add a sanction to the present undertaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon the whole, as I have not omitted
any article that can be useful to
housekeepers in particular, and families
in general, I trust I have not arrogated
to myself a right to which I have no
claim, in prefixing to my work the
title of</p>

    <div>DIFFERENT METHODS AND DEGREES OF BOILING SUGAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'><i>To clarify Sugar.</i></h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c016'>TAKE a pan proportioned in size
to the quantity of sugar you intend
to clarify: to thirty pounds of sugar,
put two gallons of water: whisk the
white of an egg in the water, and set the
pan on the fire; when the sugar begins
to boil, add half a pint of water, to prevent
its boiling over, and also to raise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the scum. Having skimmed the sugar
till there remains only a small white
scum, totally different from the other,
which is foul and black, take it off, and
strain it into the pan in which you intend
to keep it for use.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. A particular attention to these
rules, respecting the clarifying of sugar,
will greatly conduce to the effect of the
directions, which will be laid down
hereafter.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To boil Sugar to the Degree called</i> <span class='sc'>Smooth</span>.</h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> first clarified, put the quantity
of sugar required into the preserving
pan, and let it boil over the fire.
You will ascertain its having boiled to
the degree called <i>smooth</i>, by the following
experiment: Dip your finger into
the sugar; then put that finger and
your thumb together. If in opening
them you see a small thread drawn,
which breaking immediately leaves a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>drop on the finger, you may conclude
the sugar is boiled to the degree called
<i>smooth</i>.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To boil Sugar to the Degree called</i> <span class='sc'>Pearled</span>.</h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>This</span> method of boiling sugar is thus
ascertained: Take a little of the sugar
when boiling, between your finger and
thumb, and if on separation a string adheres
to both, it is boiled to the degree
called <i>pearled</i>.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To boil Sugar to the Degree called</i> <span class='sc'>Blown</span>.</h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Let</span> the sugar boil longer than on the
former occasion, and make the following
experiment: Dip the skimmer into
the sugar; take it out immediately; and
if on blowing strongly through the holes
of the skimmer, little bladders appear,
the sugar is boiled to the degree called
<i>blown</i>.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h3 class='c015'><i>To boil Sugar to the Degree called</i> <span class='sc'>Feathered</span>.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>This</span> is a higher degree of boiling
sugar than either of the former. It is
proved thus: Having dipped the skimmer
into the sugar, and shaken it over
the pan, give it a sudden flirt behind
you, when, if it flies from the skimmer
in particles resembling feathers, it is
boiled to this degree.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To boil Sugar to the Degree called</i> <span class='sc'>Crackled</span>.</h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>This</span> degree is ascertained in the
following manner: The sugar having
boiled somewhat longer than on the
former process; dip a skewer into it,
and immediately after into cold water;
if on drawing the sugar from the skewer
it snaps like glass, it is boiled to the degree
called <i>crackled</i>.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To boil Sugar to the Degree called</i> <span class='sc'>Carmelled</span>.</h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>This</span> degree is thus ascertained:
Having boiled the sugar longer still,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>dip a skewer into it, and immediately
after into cold water. If the sugar be
boiled to the degree called <i>carmelled</i>, it
will snap the very instant it touches the
cold water, and must be taken off
directly, to prevent burning and discolouration.</p>

    <div>METHODS OF PRESERVING FRUITS &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Oranges or Lemons whole.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> selected the largest and best
coloured oranges, carve them, cut a
round hole in each, where the stalk
grew; put them into a pan of cold
water, set them over the fire, and boil
them till they become so soft that you
may thrust a straw through them, shifting
the water twice during the time of
this boiling; then take them out, put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>them into cold water, and let them remain
till they become cold; after
which scoop out the cores with a spoon,
put them again into cold water, and let
them there remain forty-eight hours,
shifting the water during that space four
times: drain them when taken out, put
them into the preserving pan, cover
them with clarified sugar, and then let
them simmer over a fire for about two
hours: proceed in this manner for seven
or eight days; then drain them from
the sugar, and having prepared a fresh
quantity boiled to the degree called
<i>pearled</i>, put in the oranges, and having
boiled them for the space of an hour,
set them by for use in an earthen pan,
or put them into glasses, and cover them
with clarified sugar.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Cherries without Stones.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>For</span> a pound of cherries prepare a
pound of sugar boiled to the degree called
<i>blown</i>, into which put the cherries stoned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and having boiled them well, set them
by till the next day. Having then
strained the syrup, add some sugar and
about three pints of currant juice to it,
let it boil about half an hour, put in the
cherries, boil all together, skim well,
and afterwards set by for use.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Cherries with Stones.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> selected the finest morello
fruit, and pricked each cherry with a
needle; put them into a thin clarified
sugar, and let them simmer an hour, or
more, cautiously avoiding their coming
to a boil. Proceed thus for two or three
days; then strain the sugar from them,
and having added more sugar with some
currant juice, after a gentle boil and being
well skimmed, set them by for use.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve White Pea Plums.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Select</span> your plums before they are too
ripe, slit each of them in the seam, scald
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>them in clear water till they become
tender, then put them into cold water,
in which having remained a whole night,
drain, put them into sugar boiled to the
degree called <i>pearled</i>, and having simmered
therein twice or thrice a day for
two days, drain the syrup and boil it for
an hour, adding to it about a quart of
white currant juice. Then put in your
plums, let all boil together, and when
cold they will be fit for use.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve yellow Plums commonly called yellow Margates.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> made choice of your plums
just before they become ripe, and prepared
as much sugar to the degree called
<i>blown</i>, as will handsomely cover them,
put them in, and giving them a gentle
boil, set them by till next day and give
them another boil. The day following
drain them, and having boiled the syrup
to the degree called <i>pearled</i>, put in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>plums, and let all boil together, when
they will be fit for drying, or putting
into pots.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. You may scald and take the
skins off the plums before you preserve
them.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Damascenes.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> pricked the intended quantity,
put them into a preserving pan with
as much sugar as will cover them; give
them one good boil, take them off and
let them stand a day; on the morrow,
simmer them four or five times, and
thus let them remain three or four days;
then drain the syrup, and adding more
sugar, boil it well, put in the damascenes,
give all a good boil, skim well
and set by for use.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Mogul, or large Egg Plums.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> pricked your plums, put
them into cold water with three or four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>handfulls of salt in it, and there letting
them remain four days, scald them in
clear water till they become tender; put
them into a thin sugar, and give them a
gentle boil. This done, put them
by, and the next day let them simmer,
and so proceed for five or six days, till
you perceive the syrup becomes thick,
when it will be proper to drain and add
more sugar; boil till it is ropy, then you
may put in your plums; give them a
gentle boil and set by for use.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. You must keep the plums
under the syrup in your preserving pan
by putting a piece of board over them.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve whole Strawberries.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Prepare</span> as much sugar as will cover
the intended quantity to the degree
called <i>blown</i>, into which put the strawberries;
gently boil and set them by;
the next day drain them and boil the
syrup till it becomes ropy or <i>pearled</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>then put in the strawberries, give them
a gentle boil, skim them well, and put
them into pots.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. Rasberries are preserved in
the same manner; but it is recommended
to put some jelly drawn from
gooseberries, or white currants, into
the syrup.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Barberries in Bunches.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> prepared a sufficient quantity
of sugar to the degree called <i>blown</i>,
put in the barberries tied in small
bunches, let them boil well, then skim,
and set them by for use.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Red Currants in Bunches.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Prepare</span> as much sugar to the degree
called <i>pearled</i>, as will cover them, into
which put them, and give them a gentle
boil: then next drain them, and
adding a little more sugar, and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>juice extracted from red currants, give
the whole a good boil; skim them well,
and they will be fit for use.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. White currants are preserved
in the same manner, adding only white
currant juice to the syrup.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Green Gage Plums.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>First</span> prick your plums well with a
needle, and having laid them in salt and
water, for eight and forty hours, scald
them in pump water till they become
tender, after which put them in cold
water, and there let them remain till they
are cool; then drain and pack them
in single layers in your preserving pan;
and give them a gentle heat once a day,
for three days; this done, drain them,
add some more sugar boiled to the degree
of what is called <i>pearled</i>; then put
them in and give them a heat, but not so
far as to boil: proceed in this manner
for two or three days, till you perceive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the syrup becomes thick, then drain
them, strain the syrup, boil it to a good
height, put in your plums, give the
whole a gentle boil, set them by in pans,
and they are ready for drying out or putting
into jelly.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Green Orange Plums.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>The</span> manner is the same as that prescribed
with respect to the green gages:
but care must be taken to cover these
plums with a paper every time they are
heated, as an effectual means of keeping
in the steam and preserving the green
hue: the same method should be observed
as to green fruit in general.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Apricots.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> taken the stones out, and cut
your fruit in halves, scald them till they
are tender, and put them into cold
water: then drain, put them into a thin
sugar, give them a gentle heat and set them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>by: the next day, drain the syrup from
them, let it boil well and afterwards put
in the fruit: let the whole simmer well
together; and thus proceed from day to
day, till the apricots are duly prepared,
which may be known from the consistence
of the syrup.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. The Roman apricot is the
best to preserve, and the orange apricot
the best for jam.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Green Apricots.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Take</span> the fruit when you can thrust a
pin through the stone: prick them, and
scald them till they are tender; then
having drained, and put them into a
thin syrup, let them simmer for half an
hour every day, for a week: this done,
drain them, boil some sugar to the degree
called <i>blown</i>, to which add the
syrup, and boiling it well, put in the
fruit; let all boil together and set by.
The next day, drain it, boil the syrup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>higher, put in the fruit, and boil till
you perceive the syrup hang like a thread
from the skimmer: the fruit are then
fit for drying, or putting in jelly.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. Green almonds are preserved
in the same manner; but they should
be scalded in soft water to take the
down off.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Green Gooseberries.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Let</span> the gooseberries be gathered before
they are ripe, and scalded till they
become yellow: then put them into
cold water, and having remained twelve
hours, put them into a very thin sugar,
and heat them gently over the fire, till
you perceive they begin to be green;
after which drain the syrup from them,
and boil it to the degree called <i>pearled</i>:
put in your fruit, and having boiled all
together, set by. Proceed in this manner
for two, or three days, and the

add more sugar to the syrup, and having
boiled it to a high degree, put in the
figs, and let the whole boil up well together;
proceed in this manner every
other day for a week, by which time the
sugar will have penetrated into the fruit:

and in that state be put into a jar, with
sugar strewed over  it, boiled to the degree
called <i>smooth</i>, and covered close
down: the next day drain the syrup and
boil it up, and in this manner proceed
every day, till the water is extracted
from the pine. As the syrup by that
means will be rendered thin, you will
add more sugar and boil it up to a high
degree, and set the pine by for a fortnight,
when if you perceive the syrup
is thick, you may depend upon it the
pine is properly preserved, and therefore
may take it out of that syrup and put
it into a clarified syrup in a glass, in
which it will keep good seven years,
if unaffected by damp or wet.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Medlars.</i></h3>

  <h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Wine Sour Plums.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>These</span> plums are the best species for
preserving, on account of their tartness,
and should be treated in the same manner
as damascenes, only they will require
from their size a longer time in
preparation.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><i>To preserve Green Limes.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Having</span> scalded the limes till they
are tender, and taken out the cores, put
them into a thin sugar, and give them
a gentle boil: then set them by and
give them a gentle heat three times for
three days, by which time they will become
as green as grass: having boiled
the syrup till it become ropy, put in the
limes, boil up all together, and the fruit
will be fit for use.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. Green walnuts, or jerkins, may
be treated in the same manner as limes;
and quinces in halves and quarters, in
the same manner as pears; as there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>several species of plums, and pears, that
will not preserve, we recommend the following
experiments: put a few plums
into a little clarified sugar, and give them
a heat over a gentle fire: if they seem
to melt in the sugar they will not preserve,
if they remain firm they certainly
will, provided you adhere to the rules
laid down.</p>

    <div>OF ICE CREAMS, AND THE PROPER METHODS OF MIXING, FREEZING, AND WORKING THEM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Freezing of Ice.</i></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Have</span> ready a freezing pot in ice and
salt; put in your ice cream, cover the
pot, keep turning it till the water comes
round the pot; then open it and scrape
it down: continue turning it, and
scraping it down as it freezes, till it becomes
quite hard and smooth.</p>

<p class='c009'>If an ice cream is mixed too rich,
put in a little more cream: if it is poor,
put in some more jam. If a water ice is
mixed too rich, it will require some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>more water: if it is too poor, put in
some clarified sugar.</p>

<p class='c009'>If an ice is poor, the first time you
scrape it down, it will feel quite rough
and hard: on the contrary, if an ice is
too rich, it will not freeze at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>All fruit ices that are put into the
shapes of fruit, should have a paper
round the moulds, just as you put them
in the ice: let them lay in ice and salt
for an hour. N.B. Before you turn
your ices out, take care to make the
water come up the sides of the tub,
and in turning them out, put your
moulds just into hot water, and then out
again; then the ice cream will come out
easily.</p>

<p class='c009'>N.B. All ices that are in the shape
of fruit, should be coloured according to
the fruit they represent.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
